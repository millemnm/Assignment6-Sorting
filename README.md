A program that takes a text file filled with numbers and runs those numbers through 5 sorting algorithms, timing each one.


## Commands to run:
```bash
g++ *.cpp
./a.out
```


## Files:
  main.cpp
  
  Sorting.h
  
  Sorting.cpp
  
  
## Known Bugs:
  None.
  
  
## Notes / Extras:
  I Have made both Quick Sort and Merge Sort

  I used Chrono rather than ctime to time the sorting algorithms.
  
  I have the program output each algoritms runtime instead of the start and end time since it is more relevant.
  
  After the agorithms are sorted the program checks if any of the arrays aren't sorted and will display an error rather then its runtime.
